        <td>Ville Callio</td>
        <td>Really interesting art style. To some his games look like complete bs. Look closer and you see how much detail is put into everything.
            It may look like slop, but it's really well thought out slop.

    <tr>
        <td>Mike Klubnika</td>
        <td>The "Buckshot Roulette" guy. I can't get enough of this grungey art style. Filth covered walls, hazy nightclubs, dystopian environments. Check out some of his older works on itch if you have some time to kill.</td>
