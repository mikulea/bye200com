        Basically, I started this project in my senior year of high school, and have been working on it for about a year. I stopped around when I started
        uni as I lost time and motivation to work on it. But it was pretty fun to work on while it lasted. It actually worked decently well too, albeit a lot of polishing is still needed
        for me to call it remotely finished. The app is centered around being able to code your own music sources using javascript.

    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Features:</h4>
    <p style="margin-top: 0px;">
        Local file audio playback / importing<br>
        Custom source loading and support using JavascriptCore<br>
        Playlists<br>
        Grouped playlists (basically a group of two or more playlists, auto updating based on the content of those playlists)<br>
        Nice Looking player (imo)<br>
        Heavily customizable<br>
        Somewhat working downloads (apple makes this difficult)<br>
        Free<br>

    </p>

        There's lots of different places I can take the app, but as of 2024-11-22, I don't really have the time or motivation to work on this anymore.
        The app works, but there are a few structural things about the codebase that bug me, and preferably I want to rewrite large portions of the app. I also want to completely change the underlying database structure, which will brick everything. In turn, this will create a much more stable product, which will be easier to iterate on.
        The app isn't being binned, <strong>but I don't see myself working on it for a while</strong>. When I get a week or two off, I'll have time to actually sit and think.
        So no, you can't download it. It's not finished. It's not even close to finished. It's not even close to being close to finished. <br> All said and done, this app is by far the most complex piece of work I've ever done.
